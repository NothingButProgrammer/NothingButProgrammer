- Hi, I’m @NothingButProgrammer
- I’m interested in python and web development. 
- I’m currently learning python data structures and algorithms (sry if I said anything wrong, my English is far from perfect.)

I like doing automation stuff. Here you can see some of my bash projects. Also discord.py bots, and web scrapers.
